# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Project Overview
TerraTowns is like a central hub for Terraform enthusiasts to share and connect their personal websites. These websites are hosted on their own servers and are called TerraHouse. Terraform enthusiasts use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy their TerraHouse, which is like a tool that lets them build their websites and seamlessly integrate them into the TerraTowns community.
