# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023


## Project Overview
The task is to build and deploy a custom **Terraform provider** onto TerraTowns, integrating it with **Amazon S3** to host a static website and **Amazon CloudFront** for content delivery.
- TerraTowns is a central hub for bootcamp students to share and connect their personal websites. These websites are hosted on their own servers and are called TerraHouse.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is used to deploy the TerraHouse, which is like a tool that build the websites and seamlessly integrate them into the TerraTowns community.
